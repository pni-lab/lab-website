# PhD-position

### We are currently seeking a PhD student (m/f/d)**
in the field of **“Machine learning / Deep learning for Neuroimaging”**
 
_(Pay grade E13 TV-L / 65% - temporary employment for 36 months)._


The PhD fellow will work in the Predictive Neuroimaging Laboratory (PNI-lab), a recently established junior research group at the University Hospital Essen, in close collaborations with:

- the Bingel-Lab (https://www.uk-essen.de/clinical_neurosciences_bingel/)
- the Timmann-group (http://dagmar-timmann.de) and
- the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (https://ai.uk-essen.de).


### Challenge:

- Enhancement of MRI-processing workflows for brain connectivity analysis.
- Development of dedicated feature engineering approaches for brain network data.
- “Brain-decoding” via machine learning, based on resting-state and task-based connectivity, targeting learning dynamics and pain.
- Evaluation of the neuroscientific validity of the developed predictive models.


### Your profile:

- University degree (master or diploma) in computer science, applied mathematics or physics; eligible candidates from other disciplines are also encouraged to apply.
- Programming / software development experience with e.g. python, R, Matlab, bash.
- Expertise in at least one of the following fields is desired:
   - analysis of biomedical data and, in particular, functional and structural MRI
   - machine learning (“classical” approaches, neural networks, corss-validation)
   - statistical methods (e.g. permutation-based techniques)
- Strong English-language writing and communication skills.



### We offer:

- Working in a highly interdisciplinary environment in a recently established junior research group, embedded into the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, University Hospital Essen.
- Close collaboration with the Collaborative Research Center SFB 1280 (Extinction learning), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
- Strong links to the broader international scientific community.
- Excellent research facilities: retrospective imaging data, 3T/7T MRI scanners, high performance computing (+GPU) and a dedicated in-house software code-basis.
- Enrolment in the structured PhD graduate program “BIOME” (Graduate School of Biomedical
Science) and its scientific activities.
